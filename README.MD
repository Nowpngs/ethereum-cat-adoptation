# Cat Adoption Platform

This is a decentralized cat adoption platform built on Ethereum. The platform allows users to create and adopt virtual cats using Ethereum smart contracts.

## Backend

### Setup

To set up the backend of the platform, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/<project-name>.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-name>/backend`.
4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.

### Local Development

To develop the backend of the platform locally, you can use the following steps:

1. Compile the smart contracts by running `truffle compile`. This will generate the compiled contract artifacts in the `build/contracts` directory.
2. Download and run Ganache by following the instructions on the official Ganache website: https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache. Ganache will run a local blockchain that you can use to test your smart contracts.
3. Migrate the smart contracts to the local blockchain by running `truffle migrate`. This will deploy the contracts to the local blockchain and generate contract addresses that you can use to interact with the contracts.

### Testing

To test the backend of the platform, you can use the following steps:

1. Make sure you've compiled and migrated the smart contracts as described in the Local Development section.
2. Run the tests in the `test/` directory by running `truffle test`. This will make sure that everything is working as expected.

## Frontend

The frontend of the platform can be built using any web development framework or library. To interact with the smart contracts, you can use a library like Web3.js, which provides a JavaScript API for interacting with Ethereum.
